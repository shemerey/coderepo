#
# Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in
# [lower, upper] inclusive. Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the
# elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
#
# Note:
#
#     A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
#
# Example:
#
#     Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2, Return 3. The three
#     ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are:
#     -2, -1, 2.
